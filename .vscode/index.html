        <p> For this first visualization, I took the "high" prices data from BTC, MSTF, and FX placed it in the line chart. This data is is shown monthly but it also adjusted to show every couple months starting from the beginning of January 2017 to March 2018.

                    <p> For this second visualization, I took the "low" prices data from BTC, MSTF, and FX placed it in the line chart. This data is is shown monthly but it also adjusted to show every couple months starting from the beginning of January 2017 to March 2018.

                    <h2> Conclusion
                    </h2>
                    <p class=> From the information I gathered, MSTF is the most descent one. I would recommend this to anybody who asks me about stocks due to the fact that it is never too high or too low.
